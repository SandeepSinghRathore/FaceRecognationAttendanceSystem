# FaceRecognationAttendanceSystem

The conventional attendance system consists of registers marked by Teachers which leads to human error and a lot of maintenance.
Time consumption is an important point of concern in this system.
We have thought of revolutionize it using available digital tools in the modern era i.e. FACE RECOGNITION. 
Our project will ensure more precision and negligible manual work. 
The project is revolutionized in order to overcome the problems of conventional system. 
Face recognition and then marking the attendance is our project all about. 
The database of all the students in the class is stored in a folder and when the face of the individual student matches with one of the faces stored image,
attendance is marked else the face is ignored and attendance not marked. In our project, face recognition (Machine Learning) technology is used.
This new system will consume less time than compared to traditional methods. For this project we have used various software like Python (3.7.4),IDE and libraries.
